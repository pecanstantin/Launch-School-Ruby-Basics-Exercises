# 3. Write two methods, one that returns the string "Hello" and one that
# returns the string "World". Then print both strings using #puts,
# combining them into one sentence.

def hello1
  "Hello" # here they want strings to be returned
end

def world2
  "World"
end

puts "#{hello1} #{world2}" #remember quotation marks
